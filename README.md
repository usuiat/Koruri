# Koruri

Koruri is a declarative audio processing library built using Jetpack Compose runtime.
It enables you to describe audio processing declaratively using composable functions.

> [!WARNING]
> Koruri is an EXPERIMENTAL project.
> Do not use it in commercial products.

## Demo

- You can define waveforms and apply effects to produce various sounds.
- You can play instrument-like sounds.

## Requirements

- Min SDK 26 or higher
- Kotlin 2.0.21 or higher

## Usage

### Download

Koruri is available on Maven Central.

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation "net.engawapg.lib:koruri:$version"
}
```

The latest version: <img alt="version badge" src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/usuiat/Koruri?filter=*.*.*">

### Call Audio Composable Functions

```Kotlin
@Composable
fun KoruriSample() {
    var isPlaying by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
    var frequency by remember { mutableFloatStateOf(1000f) }

    // Audio composable
    KoruriContent {
        if (isPlaying) {
            SineWave { frequency }
        }
    }

    // UI composable
    Column {
        Switch(
            checked = isPlaying,
            onCheckedChange = { isPlaying = it }
        )
        Slider(
            value = frequency,
            onValueChange = { frequency = it },
            valueRange = 200f..2000f,
        )
    }
}
```

Koruri's entry points are `KoruriContent()` or `setKoruriContent()`.
Use `KoruriContent()` within UI composable functions, and `setKoruriContent()` elsewhere.

Then write the audio processing composable function in the entry point's `content`.
For sound sources, you can use `SineWave()`, `SquareWave()`, `InstrumentNote()`, and others.

The state of the output audio can be managed using `State`.
Changing the value of `State` triggers recomposition, causing the output audio to change.
